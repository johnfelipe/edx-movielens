# edx-movielens

This repository contains my movie recommendation system design using a filtered version of the MovieLens 10M dataset. It is part of my capstone project for the **HarvardX Data Science Specialization** on edX. All work is my own.

The repository contains the following files:

* `machine-learning-project.Rmd` - project instructions from HarvardX *(NOTE: The project instructions have slightly changed as of 1/18/19 and this document DOES NOT reflect those changes.)*
* `data-download.Rmd` - downloads the MovieLens 10M Dataset and filtering it into the EdX MovieLens Dataset used for the project using course-provided code
* `introduction.Rmd` - draft of the introduction for the final report
* `exploratory-data-analysis.Rmd` - draft of EDA for the final report
* `recommendation-systems.Rmd` - notes from HarvardX Machine Learning class using a simplified dataset *(NOTE: As of 1/27/19 there is a more up-to-date version of notes and this document does NOT reflect changes after ~1/1/19.)*
